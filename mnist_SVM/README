Introduction
============

This tool provides a simple interface to LIBSVM, a library for support vector
machines (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). It is very easy to use as
the usage and the way of specifying parameters are the same as that of LIBSVM.

Usage
=====

matlab> model = svmtrain(training_label_vector, training_instance_matrix [, 'libsvm_options']);

        -training_label_vector:
            An m by 1 vector of training labels (type must be double).
        -training_instance_matrix:
            An m by n matrix of m training instances with n features.
            It can be dense or sparse (type must be double).
        -libsvm_options:
            A string of training options in the same format as that of LIBSVM.

options:
-s svm_type : set type of SVM (default 0)
	0 -- C-SVC		(multi-class classification)
	1 -- nu-SVC		(multi-class classification)
	2 -- one-class SVM	
	3 -- epsilon-SVR	(regression)
	4 -- nu-SVR		(regression)
-t kernel_type : set type of kernel function (default 2)
	0 -- linear: u'*v
	1 -- polynomial: (gamma*u'*v + coef0)^degree
	2 -- radial basis function: exp(-gamma*|u-v|^2)
	3 -- sigmoid: tanh(gamma*u'*v + coef0)
	4 -- precomputed kernel (kernel values in training_set_file)
-d degree : set degree in kernel function (default 3)
-g gamma : set gamma in kernel function (default 1/num_features)
-r coef0 : set coef0 in kernel function (default 0)
-c cost : set the parameter C of C-SVC, epsilon-SVR, and nu-SVR (default 1)
-n nu : set the parameter nu of nu-SVC, one-class SVM, and nu-SVR (default 0.5)
-p epsilon : set the epsilon in loss function of epsilon-SVR (default 0.1)
-m cachesize : set cache memory size in MB (default 100)
-e epsilon : set tolerance of termination criterion (default 0.001)
-h shrinking : whether to use the shrinking heuristics, 0 or 1 (default 1)
-b probability_estimates : whether to train a SVC or SVR model for probability estimates, 0 or 1 (default 0)
-wi weight : set the parameter C of class i to weight*C, for C-SVC (default 1)
-v n: n-fold cross validation mode
-q : quiet mode (no outputs)

The k in the -g option means the number of attributes in the input data.

option -v randomly splits the data into n parts and calculates cross
validation accuracy/mean squared error on them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

matlab> [predicted_label, accuracy, decision_values/prob_estimates] = svmpredict(testing_label_vector, testing_instance_matrix, model [, 'libsvm_options']);
matlab> [predicted_label] = svmpredict(testing_label_vector, testing_instance_matrix, model [, 'libsvm_options']);

        -testing_label_vector:
            An m by 1 vector of prediction labels. If labels of test
            data are unknown, simply use any random values. (type must be double)
        -testing_instance_matrix:
            An m by n matrix of m testing instances with n features.
            It can be dense or sparse. (type must be double)
        -model:
            The output of svmtrain.
        -libsvm_options:
            A string of testing options in the same format as that of LIBSVM.

options:
-b probability_estimates: whether to predict probability estimates, 0 or 1 (default 0); for one-class SVM only 0 is supported


Returned Model Structure
========================

The 'svmtrain' function returns a model which can be used for future
prediction.  It is a structure and is organized as [Parameters, nr_class,
totalSV, rho, Label, ProbA, ProbB, nSV, sv_coef, SVs]:

        -Parameters: parameters
        -nr_class: number of classes; = 2 for regression/one-class svm
        -totalSV: total #SV
        -rho: -b of the decision function(s) wx+b
        -Label: label of each class; empty for regression/one-class SVM
        -sv_indices: values in [1,...,num_traning_data] to indicate SVs in the training set
        -ProbA: pairwise probability information; empty if -b 0 or in one-class SVM
        -ProbB: pairwise probability information; empty if -b 0 or in one-class SVM
        -nSV: number of SVs for each class; empty for regression/one-class SVM
        -sv_coef: coefficients for SVs in decision functions
        -SVs: support vectors

If you do not use the option '-b 1', ProbA and ProbB are empty
matrices. If the '-v' option is specified, cross validation is
conducted and the returned model is just a scalar: cross-validation
accuracy for classification and mean-squared error for regression.

More details about this model can be found in LIBSVM FAQ
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html) and LIBSVM
implementation document
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/libsvm.pdf).

Result of Prediction
====================

The function 'svmpredict' has three outputs. The first one,
predictd_label, is a vector of predicted labels. The second output,
accuracy, is a vector including accuracy (for classification), mean
squared error, and squared correlation coefficient (for regression).
The third is a matrix containing decision values or probability
estimates (if '-b 1' is specified). If k is the number of classes
in training data, for decision values, each row includes results of 
predicting k(k-1)/2 binary-class SVMs. For classification, k = 1 is a
special case. Decision value +1 is returned for each testing instance,
instead of an empty vector. For probabilities, each row contains k values
indicating the probability that the testing instance is in each class.
Note that the order of classes here is the same as 'Label' field
in the model structure.

Other Utilities
===============

A matlab function libsvmread reads files in LIBSVM format: 

[label_vector, instance_matrix] = libsvmread('data.txt'); 

Two outputs are labels and instances, which can then be used as inputs
of svmtrain or svmpredict. 

A matlab function libsvmwrite writes Matlab matrix to a file in LIBSVM format:

libsvmwrite('data.txt', label_vector, instance_matrix)

The instance_matrix must be a sparse matrix. (type must be double)
For 32bit and 64bit MATLAB on Windows, pre-built binary files are ready 
in the directory `..\windows', but in future releases, we will only 
include 64bit MATLAB binary files.

These codes are prepared by Rong-En Fan and Kai-Wei Chang from National
Taiwan University.

Examples
========

Train and test on the provided data heart_scale:

matlab> [heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst] = libsvmread('../heart_scale');
matlab> model = svmtrain(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, '-c 1 -g 0.07');
matlab> [predict_label, accuracy, dec_values] = svmpredict(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, model); % test the training data

For probability estimates, you need '-b 1' for training and testing:

matlab> [heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst] = libsvmread('../heart_scale');
matlab> model = svmtrain(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, '-c 1 -g 0.07 -b 1');
matlab> [heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst] = libsvmread('../heart_scale');
matlab> [predict_label, accuracy, prob_estimates] = svmpredict(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, model, '-b 1');

To use precomputed kernel, you must include sample serial number as
the first column of the training and testing data (assume your kernel
matrix is K, # of instances is n):

matlab> K1 = [(1:n)', K]; % include sample serial number as first column
matlab> model = svmtrain(label_vector, K1, '-t 4');
matlab> [predict_label, accuracy, dec_values] = svmpredict(label_vector, K1, model); % test the training data

We give the following detailed example by splitting heart_scale into
150 training and 120 testing data.  Constructing a linear kernel
matrix and then using the precomputed kernel gives exactly the same
testing error as using the LIBSVM built-in linear kernel.

matlab> [heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst] = libsvmread('../heart_scale');
matlab>
matlab> % Split Data
matlab> train_data = heart_scale_inst(1:150,:);
matlab> train_label = heart_scale_label(1:150,:);
matlab> test_data = heart_scale_inst(151:270,:);
matlab> test_label = heart_scale_label(151:270,:);
matlab>
matlab> % Linear Kernel
matlab> model_linear = svmtrain(train_label, train_data, '-t 0');
matlab> [predict_label_L, accuracy_L, dec_values_L] = svmpredict(test_label, test_data, model_linear);
matlab>
matlab> % Precomputed Kernel
matlab> model_precomputed = svmtrain(train_label, [(1:150)', train_data*train_data'], '-t 4');
matlab> [predict_label_P, accuracy_P, dec_values_P] = svmpredict(test_label, [(1:120)', test_data*train_data'], model_precomputed);
matlab>
matlab> accuracy_L % Display the accuracy using linear kernel
matlab> accuracy_P % Display the accuracy using precomputed kernel

Note that for testing, you can put anything in the
testing_label_vector.  For more details of precomputed kernels, please
read the section ``Precomputed Kernels'' in the README of the LIBSVM
package.
